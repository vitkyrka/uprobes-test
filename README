ARM UPROBES TEST CODE

This is an implementation of a userspace harness for the ARM kernel kprobes
test code in order to allow it to be used for testing of uprobes.

The setting of the uprobe on the instruction under test and the checking of
the uprobe hit are done via the tracing files in debugfs.

The probes before and after the instruction point used by the kprobes test code
to prepare registers and verify their state after execution of the probed
instruction are implemented by inserting undefined instructions and handling
SIGILL in userspace.
